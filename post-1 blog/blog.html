                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Programming is a field that encompasses a myraid of topics and skills from a software engineer to a digital marketer. Other than
                    that, there are also data scientist, web developer,database administrator, business intelligence analyst and the list goes on. All of 
                    these careers are very different of one another, the only thing that embound them into the same category fundamentally is all of 
                    these professions need the knowledge of programming. They all started off as a beginner not knowing anything about programming. 
                    Maybe they started learning python or javscipt first, then they move into php and R. We should know that they are two common career 
                    tracks which are front end web development and back end web development. All these professions that was mentioned above came to be 
                    from these two fundamental categories.</p>
                 <h2>What is web development?</h2>   
                 <p>In lay mens terms, web development is the development of websites for the internet. Web development will normally focus on the technical 
                    aspect of creating a website such as contructing layouts, programming and integrating applications and graphics. The web development stack
                    is an overview of what web developer needs to know. There are 6 categories which are front end, back end, APIs+ Data Transfer ,Infra+ 
                    Networking, databases and security. 
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div class="front">
                <h1>What is front end development?</h1>
                <p>Front end development is a part of web development that focus on the visual output of the websites such as the designs of the webpage,
                    for instance, the color, background image, the layout and so on.Normally after coding, when you run your files, it will automatically shows your website's 
                    results on the screen. From my personal experience, if you are a person who focus on the technical disipline of logic and thinking then front end
                    is definetely wise to be on the front end.
                    
                        For a front end developer, implementation of visual components on a website as well as interactive features such as button control
                    ,text input and output and so on. Normally, to start up as a front end develper, the basic programming langauge that must be mastered
                    are HTML, CSS and Java Script. These are the very essential as they are your tools to help you build the entire website from designing
                    to integrating with different library(we will talk about this in later post) to have better ready made function that makes life easier.
                    A lot of you, might wonder, why not just use Wordpress or Godaddy which are hosting companies that offers tools that can create website 
                    without programming. For beginners it might sound better, but when you are to create a more complex website such as a dynamic website which 
                    stores data like Amazon.com and Shopee.com  Wordpress , Godaddy and other similar website won't be able to help you with that. Just to 
                    let you know, these hosting platform are actually just using ready-made templetes for you to choose from and modify it yourself.
                    Where is the creativity and skilss in there?Sure, ou will pick up some editting skills on the way but you cannot have it a hundred percent your 
                    way. Moreover, it is expensive.  </p>

                    <h1>What is back end development?</h1>
                    <p>First let's revisit the front end development, as we all know front end development is the practice of creating user interfaces that are
                        flexible and it is use for intraction between data. So, back-end development is a practice of creating those plugs into the data often
                        times called an API which stands for Application Program Interface. Basically, back-end programs are not visible to the user, they are 
                        usually incognito to the user. Typically, a back-end developer must have a strong knowledge of programming and math because the function
                        that the developers are working with are more abstract. This is because it is not visible, the developers have to imagine how it works
                        and use math and programming functions to solve it.
                            Now, what are the programming language should we master in order to be a back-end developer, in general back-end developer
                        creates or develops the APIs. This is to ensure that the user interact with the data safely. Usually, there are two types of langauges
                        to learn, the first is the server-side programming language that helps to build that helps to build the APIs itslef. The commonly used langauges are 
                        Python, Java, Ruby and PHP. Next, the SQL langauge which is to fetch the data from the data base.
                        
                        Some skills that are require by back end developer:
                        -A strong understanding of varies programming langauge such as Python, Java, Ruby, PHP and SQL
                        -Architectural skilss for making testable, extensible and well-organised programs.
                        -Have great logic and organizing data skilss</p>
                        
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>Back end developer jobs and salary:</h3>
                    <p>For a back-end developer, there are jobs such as Java developer, DevOps Developer, Software Engineer, software engineer and IOS developer.
                        From what I found the salary of the average back-end developer is higher than front end developer.The average fresh graduates will have around,
                        $60,000 per year and the numbers can go up to over $100000 with the right demand.</p>
