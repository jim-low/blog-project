               <h1>Introduction</h1>
               <p>
 
                The field of front end development has been booming over the past decade. Millions and millions of websites has been created
                to compansate the demand of people having to find more and more information everyday. Thus, companies are wildly recruting front-end 
                developers. Naturally, the salary of front-end developers has increased year after year. 
                
                Recently, there have been questions by people all over the internet asking advice on how to get strated as a front-end developer.
                For almost twenty years, the field of front-end development has broaden to a level that it could take years to truly be able to 
                grasp all the concepts and newset features.It could be quite overhelming starting out in the field of front-end development. 
                
                 There are a few tips that I will share with you guys to start up:</p>

                 <blockquote>
                    "Front-end development is like an maze.You happen to be stuck in it, but with no sense of direction. First understand and learn to use the surroundding
                    ,then go deep."
                 </blockquote>

                 <h2>1.Learn basic HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                 <p>There is no way around this. Learning programming langauges such as HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT is crucial to be a sucessful front-end developer
                    . Programming is basically the foundation or the pillars of front-end developer. Without it, is like having a car without wheels. Now, 
                    there are all kinds of tutorials to learn from but is it essential to pick one with the best quality.
                    
                    My recommandation is to sign up at Online Courses like Coursera or Edx. There you will find all the knowledge you need as these courses
                    are made by prestiges Universities like MIT, Havard and Oxford so you won't have to worry about the quality of the content, there are
                    top-notch. For some of you that are facing financial difficluties you don't have to worry because there is a place to apply for financial
                    aid. For your information, you don't have to pay for most of the courses to view the cotents but to obtain the certificate, payment is
                    essential.</p>

                    <h2>2. Create and Build</h2>
                    <p>That's right, building side projects. Only by building side projects  will you truly be able to grasp the concepts that you have learn
                        from the tutorials. By having side projects, you are basically applying what you have learn into real world experience. For example,you 
                        could start your own website or blog by using the knowledge you have learn. 
                        
                        Building to learn!!! There is no better way to learn than getting your hands dirty. You've probably heard this a million times that why I
                        cannot emphasize enough the importance of creating your own digital portfoilo.
                        </p>

                    <h2>3.Read, read and read.</h2>
                    <p>There is no escaping from reading if you want to be sucessful in the field of front-end development. Reading is the most conventional way of 
                        studying that has been used by all the greatest achievers in the history of mankind. That is why there is no better way to start by reading.
                        
                        At first, you should probably read a lot of articles, guides and coding reference on the different functions and the way it works. 
                        Reading other peoples code is by far the most important part of reading after you have understand all the concepts. Stake Overflow 
                        is one of the place you can visit, you can post questions and answers will be given because there is a entire community inside it.
                        
                        Last but not least, there is a good book that I will recommand: xxxxxxxx. It is completely free.  No worries.
                        
                        4. Online resourses
                        As you start your journey with front-end development, you will need quality online resources that helps you run things smoothly. It is
                        essential to have great online resources even for experience programmer as sometimes you will need to check on some of the commands of 
                        your code. Here are a few place you can use:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#">free code camp</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">w3school</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">youtube</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">online rgb</a></li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>4. No rushing</h2>
                    <p>There may be times you ask yourself why are you doing this and that and you may just feel like stopping. It may be really tempting 
                        to just give up. My advice, please reconsider. You will definetely regret it in the future, now is the best time for you the cease
                        your moment.
                    
                        If you feel you can't go on, just ask questions in some of the community forums such as Reddit, Facebook Groups, Google, StakeOver Flow,
                        etc.....
                    </p>

                    <h2>Final words.</h2>
                    <p>In conclusion, becoming a front-end developer is more than leaarning varies frameworks and coding langauges. It is also about interaction
                        ,disipline and responsibilities. In the future, you may need to work with others and it is very important to know your role.
                        
                        The path to become a front-end developer may take some time but let me tell you it is worth it. In the end of the day, you will only 
                        feel satisfy and happy. By the way, have fun learning as you progress. Good Luck!!!</p>
